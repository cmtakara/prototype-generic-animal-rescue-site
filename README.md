# prototype-generic-animal-rescue-site
This is (currently) a generic website for an animal rescue


The Assignment that this is representing is:
Find a website with some design patterns/layout and use Flexbox to recreate the layout.
Content and images are optional. I am mainly looking for the layout of the website.
It doesn't have to be exactly the same, you can pick and choose which part of the design you want to implement.

The inspiration websites are in the comments of the index.  The intent is to start with the framework/prototype that meets the
requirements of the assignment, and then fill in the content and imagages, as well as build on the functionality.

The colors are purpopsely chosen in this iteration to be contrasting and highlight each of the different aspects of the pattern/layout.

The page is for a dog and cat rescue.  The logo and color theme will be provided by the rescue.
For the rescue, there are aspects that may not be accessible to the public (a table to track the animals, their vetting, where they currently are, etc)
There is also a page for volunteers (that go to the locations the cats are) to provide inputs.
The may be a page for fosters - to give feedback or issues or ???
For the general public, there are pages to see the dogs and the cats that are available, to apply to adopt an animal, to apply to foster, to apply to volunteer
